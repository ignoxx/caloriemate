            Analyze the provided image of a meal with extreme attention to detail. Include:

            **Overall Assessment:**
            - What type of dish or meal is this? (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, appetizer, etc.)
            - General cooking style and preparation method
            - Overall presentation and serving style

            **Detailed Food Description:**
            - Every visible ingredient, no matter how small
            - Specific cooking methods for each component (grilled, fried, baked, steamed, raw, etc.)
            - Textures, colors, and visual characteristics
            - Any garnishes, seasonings, or condiments visible

            **Portion and Size Analysis:**
            - Use any visible reference objects (utensils, plates, hands, coins) to estimate scale
            - Describe relative sizes and proportions of different components
            - If items are countable (eggs, slices, pieces), provide exact counts
            - Estimate thickness, volume, and coverage area of different foods

            **Preparation Details:**
            - Visible oil, grease, or cooking fats
            - Sauces, dressings, or liquid components
            - Cooking doneness (rare, well-done, crispy, soft, etc.)
            - Any visible seasoning or spice application

            **Context Clues:**
            - Serving vessel (plate, bowl, tray type and size)
            - Setting indicators (restaurant vs home, formal vs casual)
            - Any packaging or branding visible
            - Temperature indicators (steam, condensation, melted items)
